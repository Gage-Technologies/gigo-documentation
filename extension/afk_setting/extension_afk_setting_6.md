# AFK Setting and Timeouts
>#### You still there?

When a workspace is started, it has a timeout of 30 minutes. Meaning that if a user does not open the workspace within 30 minutes it will stop the workspace.

However, once a user is in the workspace there is a timeout for inactivity. If a user is not active in the workspace for 10 minutes the workspace will automatically close. Both of these timeouts allow Gigo services to be cost-effective and consistent, as it saves server resources on unused workspaces.

The Gigo Extension offers an AFK Setting that will allow users to be inactive in a workspace for up to an hour. It's as simple as clicking a button!

If you need to be inactive for more than an hour, don't worry! You can always restart the workspace once you return and your work will have been saved with the Automatic Git Control System.
