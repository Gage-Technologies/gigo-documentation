# AFK Setting and Timeouts
>#### You still there?

When a DevSpace is started, it has a timeout of 30 minutes. Meaning that if a user does not open the DevSpace within 30 minutes it will stop the DevSpace.

However, once a user is in the DevSpace there is a timeout for inactivity. If a user is not active in the DevSpace for 10 minutes the DevSpace will automatically close. Both of these timeouts allow Gigo services to be cost-effective and consistent, as it saves server resources on unused workspaces.

The Gigo Extension offers an AFK Setting that will allow users to be inactive in a DevSpace for up to an hour. It's as simple as clicking a button!

If you need to be inactive for more than an hour, don't worry! You can always restart the DevSpace once you return and your work will have been saved with the Automatic Git Control System.
