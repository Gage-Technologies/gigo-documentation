# Extension Overview
>#### Helping Vscode

</br>

### **What is Vscode?**

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open source *IDE* (Integrated Development Environment) that is developed by Microsoft. Vscode is the industry standard development environment for programmers and offers a very customizable interface. When a user launches a workspace on Gigo, they will be thrust into an in-browser version of Vscode known as [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server). Both the Gigo workspaces and extension run inside code-server.

### **What is the Gigo Extension?**
The Gigo Extension is designed to assist users in interacting with the features of Gigo.  
The extension consists of six main components:
- [Gigo Code Teacher](../extension/code_teacher/extension_code_teacher_2.md)
- [Automatic Git Pushes and Commits](../extension/automatic_git/extension_automatic_git_3.md)
- [The Tutorial Viewer](../extension/tutorial_viewer/extension_tutorial_viewer_4.md)
- [The Tutorial Creator](../extension/tutorial_creator/extension_tutorial_creator_5.md)
- [The AFK Setting](../extension/afk_setting/extension_afk_setting_6.md)

</br>

The Gigo extension is automatically installed in every workspace, however, a user is not required to use all features of the extension. Some of these features a user can disable in the *User Settings* on the Gigo platform. In particular, the Automatic Git system can be completely disabled if a user wishes to manage their own Git tree.

### **Does this conflict with other extensions?**

The Gigo extension is designed to be minimally intrusive and compatible with other extensions a user might want to install. The chief design intention of the extension is to assist users with the basic functionality of the Gigo system.
