# Gigo Code Teacher
>#### Your own personal tutor.

The Gigo Teacher is personal tutor designed to help users with all things programming. It seamlessly integrates with all code a user writes or interacts with inside the workspace.

### **What makes Gigo Code Teacher Different?**

Code Teacher integrates with the user's workspace and is context-aware. This means that when the user has a question about their project, Code Teacher functions like a tutor, reading their code with them.

This is contrary to the way in which normal AI (Artificial Intelligence) driven code tutors work. Typically, when using an online AI tutor, a user must manually input all their code into the system and then ask the system for help. This leads to less accurate results since users cannot provide all relevant information.

Since Code Teacher is already aware of the user's environment it can provide specific help to the problems the user has.

### **How Do I Use Code Teacher?**

Gigo Code Teacher is very easy to use. It's as simple as asking Code Teacher a question by clicking the Code Teacher Icon shown in th image below.

</br>

Once you click this icon a chat window will open where you can ask Code Teacher any question about best practices, how to fix errors/problems, examples on how to approach certain designs, or even how to improve code you have already written.

### **Advanced Code Writing**

Stuck on a problem? Ask Code Teacher! It's simple really. Code Teacher has knowledge on a vast variety of topics and is quite capable of problem-solving.

### **Context Based Conversations**

When a user writes code in a workspace, this code is then fed (in the background) into Code Teacher. This allows Code Teacher to be "context aware" of how the user writes code and what they are working on.

In the example above we asked Code Teacher to explain how the "FollowUser" function works in the GIGO codebase. It then explained the steps that the function performs in order.

</br>

Code Teacher will retain a "memory" of a previous message within the same conversation. This gives users the option to "speak freely" with Code Teacher.

In this example, after we had asked Code Teacher to explain the "FollowUser" function in the previous example, we then asked "How is FollowUser used in the api?". Code Teacher then used the context of the previous question to inform its answer of our current question.


### **Code Teacher Limits**

Code Teacher is still under development, which means that every new user to Gigo will get a free month of Code Teacher. Even after that month a user without a premium account will still be able to use Code Teacher! They will simply be limited to 3 Code Teacher messages per day.

For more information on Premium Accounts, see the [Get Pro](../pro/pro_purchase_2.md) Documentation.
